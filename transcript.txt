 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
| Name:           New York Knicks                                                                  |

| Description:    The New York Knickerbockers, commonly referred to as the Knicks, are a profession|
|                 al basketball team based in New York City, New York. The Knicks are part of the A|
|                 tlantic Division of the Eastern Conference in the National Basketball Association|
|                 . The team, established by Ned Irish in 1946, was one of the founding members of |
|                 the Basketball Association of America, which became the NBA after merging with th|
|                 e rival National Basketball League in 1949. The team plays at Madison Square Gard|
|                 en, above Pennsylvania Station in the borough of Manhattan, and along with the Bo|
|                 ston Celtics is one of only two NBA teams still located in its original city. The|
|                  Knicks were successful during their early years and were constant playoff conten|
|                 ders under the franchise's first head coach Joe Lapchick. Beginning in 1950, the |
|                 Knicks made three consecutive appearances in the NBA Finals, all of which were lo|
|                 sing efforts. Lapchick resigned in 1956 and the team subsequently began to falter|
|                 . It was not until the late 1960s when Red Holzman became head coach that the Kni|
|                 cks began to regain their former dominance. Holzman successfully guided the Knick|
|                 s to two championship titles in 1970 and 1973.                                   |

| Description:    The Miami Heat are an American professional basketball team based in Miami, Flori|
|                 da. The team is a member of the Southeast Division in the Eastern Conference of t|
|                 he National Basketball Association. They play their home games at the American Ai|
|                 rlines Arena in Downtown Miami. The team owner is Micky Arison, who also owns cru|
|                 ise-ship giant Carnival Corporation. The team president and de facto general mana|
|                 ger is Pat Riley, and the head coach is Erik Spoelstra. The mascot of the team is|
|                  Burnie, an anthropomorphic fireball. Formed in 1988 as one of the NBA's four exp|

|                 ing the 2005–06 and 2011–12 seasons.                                             |
